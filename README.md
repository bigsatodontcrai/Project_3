## Project Overview ![Adventurer2](/Documentation/images/adventurer2.png)
For our EECS 448 project 3 we decided to create a platformer game. Similar to a Mario game. The goal of the game is to avoid enemies and get as many coins as possible before time runs out. 

## Installation ![Adventurer4](Documentation/images/adventurer4.png)
